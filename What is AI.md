AI is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions
including the ability to see
understand and translate spoken and written language
analyze data
make recommendations
involve creating machines that can think like humans and imitate their actions

Generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders are two of the most popular approaches used for producing AI-generated content.

The variational approach is a technique used to approximate complex probability distributions. 

Generative Pre-trained Transformers, commonly known as GPT, are a family of neural network models that uses the transformer architecture and is a key advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) powering generative AI applications such as ChatGPT.

Transformers need lots of good data to work well, while VAEs work better with less data. The quality of the results. GANs are better for clear and detailed images, while VAEs are better for smoother results

How will AI change our lives in ten years?
AI has the potential to significantly increase worldwide economic growth rates within the next 10 years through productivity gains, intelligent systems that supplement human work, and new opportunities created by technology.

What jobs will be replaced by AI? and what new professions will it creat?
Jobs that are most likely to be automated by 2030 include cashiers, telemarketers, data entry clerks, and customer service agents. Advances in AI's data analysis and decision-making capabilities could potentially affect even some white-collar jobs, such as legal assistants and financial advisors.
