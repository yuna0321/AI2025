📚 How They Affect the Verb Form
In Xhosa, subject prefixes are attached directly to the verb stem and sometimes combined with other markers (like tense or object prefixes). Let’s dissect a few to see how they work.

Example: Bafundisa
ba- (they) + fundisa (teach) → “they teach”

Example: Ningabafundisa
ni- (you pl) + nga- (can) + ba- (them) + fundisa (teach) → “you (pl) can teach them”

Example: Usandibona?
u- (you sg) + sa- (still) + ndi- (me) + bona (see) → “do you still see me?”

🧠 Summary Table
English Subject	Xhosa Prefix
I	ndi-
You (sg)	u-
He/She	u- (same as "you (sg)")
We	si-
You (pl)	ni-
They	ba-
These prefixes are essential in Xhosa and appear in nearly every verb phrase, acting like tiny pronouns built into the verb.

### Q3.2 Morphological Parsing (Using GAI as a tutor)
✅ Model's Expected Answer:
Let's break down "Ndingasifundisa":

Part	Meaning
Ndi-	Subject prefix: "I"
-nga-	Modal marker: "can" or "could"
-si-	Object prefix: "it" (referring to something like a language or subject)
-fundisa	Verb root: "teach"
✅ Full Interpretation:
"Ndingasifundisa" = "I can teach it"

This is a fully inflected verb form.

In this case, “it” could refer to a subject like isiNgesi (English), isiFrentshi (French), etc.


Recognizing how morphology carries subject, object, and modality all in one verb word.
