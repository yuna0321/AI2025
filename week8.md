🔤 Xhosa Subject Prefixes from Examples
Subject	Xhosa Prefix	Example Sentence	English Translation
I	ndi-	Ndisafunda.	I still learn.
You (sg)	u-	Ubafundisa. / Usandibona?	You teach them. / Do you still see me?
He/She	u-	(not explicitly given, but same as “you sg”)	-
We	si-	Sikwafunda isiFrentshi.	We also learn French.
You (pl)	ni-	Ningabafundisa. / Niyathetha.	You (pl) can teach them. / You (pl) speak.
They	ba-	Bafundisa isiJamani. / Bayanithanda? / Bakwafunda isiNgesi.	They teach German. / Do they like you (pl)? / They also learn English.
📚 How They Affect the Verb Form
In Xhosa, subject prefixes are attached directly to the verb stem and sometimes combined with other markers (like tense or object prefixes). Let’s dissect a few to see how they work.

Example: Bafundisa
ba- (they) + fundisa (teach) → “they teach”

Example: Ningabafundisa
ni- (you pl) + nga- (can) + ba- (them) + fundisa (teach) → “you (pl) can teach them”

Example: Usandibona?
u- (you sg) + sa- (still) + ndi- (me) + bona (see) → “do you still see me?”

🧠 Summary Table
English Subject	Xhosa Prefix
I	ndi-
You (sg)	u-
He/She	u- (same as "you (sg)")
We	si-
You (pl)	ni-
They	ba-
These prefixes are essential in Xhosa and appear in nearly every verb phrase, acting like tiny pronouns built into the verb.

### Q3.2 Morphological Parsing (Using GAI as a tutor)
✅ Model's Expected Answer:
Let's break down "Ndingasifundisa":

Part	Meaning
Ndi-	Subject prefix: "I"
-nga-	Modal marker: "can" or "could"
-si-	Object prefix: "it" (referring to something like a language or subject)
-fundisa	Verb root: "teach"
✅ Full Interpretation:
"Ndingasifundisa" = "I can teach it"

This is a fully inflected verb form.

In this case, “it” could refer to a subject like isiNgesi (English), isiFrentshi (French), etc.


Recognizing how morphology carries subject, object, and modality all in one verb word.

### Q3.3 AI Translation Challenge (Prompt → Translate → Compare)
✅ Expected Xhosa Translation:
“Basasithanda.”

✅ Breakdown & Analysis
a) How is “still” marked in the verb?
"sa-" = This is the continuous/still marker in Xhosa.

It goes between the subject prefix and the object prefix.

b) What is the object prefix for “us”?
"si-" = This refers to “us”.

🔍 Morphological Breakdown of “Basasithanda”
Part	Meaning
Ba-	Subject prefix: They
sa-	Aspect marker: Still
si-	Object prefix: Us
thanda	Verb root: Love
✅ So: Ba-sa-si-thanda = “They still love us”
